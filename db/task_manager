  description: '"Be a man!" said I.  "You are scared out of your wits!  What good
    is religion if it collapses under calamity?  Think of what earthquakes and floods,
    wars and volcanoes, have done before to men!  Did you think God had exempted Weybridge?  He
    is not an insurance agent." For a time he sat in blank silence. "But how can we
    escape?" he asked, suddenly.  "They are invulnerable, they are pitiless." "Neither
    the one nor, perhaps, the other," I answered. "And the mightier they are the more
    sane and wary should we be.  One of them was killed yonder not three hours ago."
    "Killed!" he said, staring about him.  "How can God''s ministers be killed?" "I
    saw it happen." I proceeded to tell him.  "We have chanced to come in for the
    thick of it," said I, "and that is all." "What is that flicker in the sky?" he
    asked abruptly. I told him it was the heliograph signalling--that it was the sign
    of human help and effort in the sky. "We are in the midst of it," I said, "quiet
    as it is.  That flicker in the sky tells of the gathering storm.  Yonder, I take
    it are the Martians, and Londonward, where those hills rise about Richmond and
    Kingston and the trees give cover, earthworks are being thrown up and guns are
    being placed.  Presently the Martians will be coming this way again." And even
    as I spoke he sprang to his feet and stopped me by a gesture. "Listen!" he said.
    From beyond the low hills across the water came the dull resonance of distant
    guns and a remote weird crying.  Then everything was still. A cockchafer came
    droning over the hedge and past us.  High in the west the crescent moon hung faint
    and pale above the smoke of Weybridge and Shepperton and the hot, still splendour
    of the sunset. "We had better follow this path," I said, "northward." My younger
    brother was in London when the Martians fell at Woking. He was a medical student
    working for an imminent examination, and he heard nothing of the arrival until
    Saturday morning.  The morning papers on Saturday contained, in addition to lengthy
    special articles on the planet Mars, on life in the planets, and so forth, a brief
    and vaguely worded telegram, all the more striking for its brevity. The Martians,
    alarmed by the approach of a crowd, had killed a number of people with a quick-firing
    gun, so the story ran.  The telegram concluded with the words: "Formidable as
    they seem to be, the Martians have not moved from the pit into which they have
    fallen, and, indeed, seem incapable of doing so.  Probably this is due to the
    relative strength of the earth''s gravitational energy."  On that last text their
    leader-writer expanded very comfortingly.  My brother felt no anxiety about us,
    as he knew from the description in the papers that the cylinder was a good two
    miles from my house.  He made up his mind to run down that night to me, in order,
    as he says, to see the Things before they were killed.  He dispatched a telegram,
    which never reached me, about four o''clock, and spent the evening at a music
    hall. In London, also, on Saturday night there was a thunderstorm, and my brother
    reached Waterloo in a cab.  On the platform from which the midnight train usually
    starts he learned, after some waiting, that an accident prevented trains from
    reaching Woking that night.  The nature of the accident he could not ascertain;
    indeed, the railway authorities did not clearly know at that time.  There was
    very little excitement in the station, as the officials, failing to realise that
    anything further than a breakdown between Byfleet and Woking junction had occurred,
    were running the theatre trains which usually passed through Woking round by Virginia
    Water or Guildford.  They were busy making the necessary arrangements to alter
    the route of the Southampton and Portsmouth Sunday League excursions.  A nocturnal
    newspaper reporter, mistaking my brother for the traffic manager, to whom he bears
    a slight resemblance, waylaid and tried to interview him.  Few people, excepting
    the railway officials, connected the breakdown with the Martians.'
